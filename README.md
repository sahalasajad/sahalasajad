## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me

I’m a student from Kerala who jumped into the tech world with no clue what GitHub even was — and now I’m here, trying, building, learning every single day. I love turning random ideas into real things.
💡 Recently joined a hackathon *randomly* with my friends — and we won **3rd prize**! 😄  
✨ I’m all about making tech feel *doable* for beginners like me.  
🤝 I enjoy leading, learning in public, and helping other women in tech grow confidently.
